	What I've done:
		1. Began testing PCB
		2. Loading 6g6vt code onto ESP32
		3. Began integrating 6v6gt code to my state machine code
	Goals for next week:
		1. Edit 2nd round of PCB
		2. Order 2nd round of PCB
		3. Keep working towards finishing state maching code

Lab 9/23
	What I've done:
		1. Made edits to PCB
			- Increased 3V3 power trace width to 0.635 mm
			- Moved phone jacks, ESP32, and SD card adapter to the edge of the board
		2. Made edits to schematic
			- Fixed connections on pin 5 and 6 of U6
			- Moved FIRSTRING output pin from 34 (only input pin) to 26
			- Opened 2nd GND pin on esp32 and connected it to GND.
			- Changed J3 Tip+ to Ring+.
		3. Edited and tested first PCB
			- Cut trace from R7 to R8.
			- Cut trace from R7 to R14.
			- Connected R7 to pin 5 of U6
			- Connected R8 to R14.
			- Connected R14 to pin 6 of U6.
			- Ring detection worked
			- Ring suppression didn't work? -- I didn't have Ring pin connected to Ring, FirstRing needed to
				be on high
			- Phone pick up detection worked
			- On/off hook detection worked
			- Hook flash detection worked
			- LED doesn't light up, need to switch MOSFET
			- Hysteresis probably don't need..
			- Incoming voice disappears after R6
			- Ordered Micro SD card connector, need to make symbol and footprint for schematic and PCB
		4. Edited second PCB
			- Cut trace from R7 to R8.
			- Cut trace from R7 to R14.
			- Connected R7 to pin 5 of U6
			- Connected R8 to R14.
			- Connected R14 to pin 6 of U6.
			- Phone pick up detection worked
	Goals for next week:
		1. Finish up debugging
		2. Order PCB

Lab 9/30
	What I've done:
		1. Make edits to schematic
			- Drawn rectangles on board for each subcircuit
			- Changed M1 to Q1
			- Switched Q1 IRF530PBF to 2N7000
			- Made sure capacitors were all ceramics
			- Replaced resistors < 5% to 5% tolerance
			- Added test points
		2. Ordered PCB
	Goals for next week:
		1. Work with Scott to read audio out of DAC
		2. Work on state machine code
