In this past week:
1) I have begun setting up my pi to run the python code that I've written in 403
    This was a little difficult because I had to debug my pi. I had to reformat the SD card
    and do a fresh install.

Goals for next week:
1) I plan to get python running on my pi with the correct version to ensure the code will work (python ver 3.9.12)
2) I'm going to run the python code to see if it works.
3) Additionally, I am going to work on my ML code to account for unknown voices to be passed through the system.
   As of right now I am still figuring out a way to tackle this issue.
