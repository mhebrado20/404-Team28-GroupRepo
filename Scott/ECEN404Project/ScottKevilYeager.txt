Week 0 - Directory issue needs to be fixed for storing audio recordings
		-ESP32 transmits data wirelessly and through serial but I can't find where it is stored

Week 1 - Still working on audio recording, I was approaching serial recording of the audio incorrectly and was informed by my sponsor
to avoid the wifi communication between the host computer (PI or PC) and the esp32 and to instead focus on sending serialized JSON packets
that will then be decoded by the host computer, written to a local file, and then stored in the MongoDB database on the same computer.
		-This past week I have found resources on JSON packet serialization and methods to send audio through these JSON packets

Goals to have complete by next week
	-Be able to send a serialized packet containing variables for audio recording bytes, and hardware information received by AMy's
	hardware subsystem and have those packets written to a file
